# ASL-recognition-with-CNN
- what is ASL: American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.
- in this learning project, I have made a neural network based on CNN that can take ASL images as input and return associated letters to that.
